  <h2>Supporting COMAT with Every Fidget</h2>
  <p>
    Every time you buy a fidget, part of that money goes directly to
    <a href="https://www.comateams.org/" target="_blank">COMAT</a> — a nonprofit helping martial artists
    travel to events, training, and competitions.
  </p>
  <p>
    COMAT is a organization committed to helping martial artists reach their goals by
    removing financial barriers. We’re proud to contribute to their mission.
  </p>

  <h2>About the Creator</h2>
  <p>
    These fidgets are created by a designer and some designs from others on makerworld @Zabois29, @YANGYANG0710, and @the3Dimagineer.
  </p>
  <p>
    What began as a kid doing martial arts for fun turned into friendships and support for the martial arts community, Inspired by a love
    of martial arts and 3D printing, each fidget is made with quality and care.
